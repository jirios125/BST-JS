# BST-JS
TO ADD:<br>
	-findDeepest -> Should return all of the deepest nodes<br>
	-Add some validations when making the bt (ordered numbers, righ-child only, left-child only)<br>
	-Make some testing for all the methods of the tree<br>

Hi, I'm glad you are reading this.
This is a test done for Slingr/Veritone.

<h5>The chosen language to make this thest was Javascript</h5><br>
This test is made based on personal knowledge, information on the web and the book: <h5>Algorithms + data structures = programs by Niklaus Wirth.</h5>

To test this code you can either do a pull and run it in your local IDE or access this link and be able to run it online.
[Acces code online here](https://playcode.io/924475)

These are the requirements to be met by this test:
Implement a BST and all its methods.<br>
The BST must be constructed from an array of integers.<br>
Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes of the BST along with their depth.<br>
Example of deepest node and depth:<br>
	Input: 12,11,90,82,82,7,9.<br>
	Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3<br>
	Input: 26, 82, 16, 92, 33<br>
	Output: deepest, 33, 92; depth, 2<br>

What we are looking for is:<br>
Correctness: will your solution produce the desired results?<br>
Conciseness: is your solution clear and brief?<br>
Maintainability: does the code resist changing needs?<br>
Antipatterns: does your solution avoid antipatterns?<br>
